I'm D2 doing the grind like we all our. Guy gets into lobby says hey guys first ranked game wish me luck. Instant
 dodge?
The next queue pops and I have him again? Hey guys first ranked
 game wish me luck__. This lobby doesn't instantly dodge. Guy locks Xayah adc so you can kinda see where this is going and it did go that way.
But the team didn't flame him... in fact it was mostly positive .Stop missing CS or you're reported. This dude came in bright eyed and bushy tailed, because 
he was a furry in a fursuit (he even sang my fursona a song) just!? Wanting to erotic roleplay. Example, "the Rakan (me) tells him hey when" I W in you ult.  Rawr x3 nuzzles how are you pounces on you you're so warm o3o notices you have a bulge o: 
someone's happy...I nuzzles your "necky" wecky~ murr~!!!
The guy made a lot of mistakes
 but they were ignorant mistakes. 
test isn't good.
