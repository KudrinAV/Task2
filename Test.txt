I'm D2 doing the grind like we all our. Guy gets into lobby says "hey guys first ranked game wish me luck __". Instant dodge.
The next queue pops and I have him again. "hey guys first ranked game wish me luck __." This lobby doesn't instantly dodge. .... guy locks Xayah adc so you can kinda see where this is going and it did go that way.
But the team didn't flame him... in fact it was mostly positive ("Stop missing CS or you're reported.") This dude came in bright eyed and bushy tailed, because he was a furry in a fursuit (he even sang my fursona a song) just .... wanting to erotic roleplay. Example, the Rakan (me) tells him "hey when I W in you ult". 2 minutes later, I W in and wouldn't you know it Xayah ults in the wrong direction and types "Rawr x3 nuzzles how are you pounces on you you're so warm o3o notices you have a bulge o: someone's happy ;) nuzzles your necky wecky~ murr~"
The guy made a lot of mistakes but they were ignorant mistakes. It was awful to see someone get on the rift and just type the entire match and ask me to describe my fantasies. We lost that game and I probably won't be making Masters this year but for the first time in a long time, I was really uncomfortable playing with this guy.
I think sexual harassment report options and virtual restraining orders is something this game (or at least the longer playing community) is missing.
